### SG-SWR1
Arrived: 12:55  
Exited: 14:15  
Personnel: Worsham, Shirley

Data download and maintenance. Snow DTPs in real bad shape. Broken by elk. Removing both. Looked for other sensors that were still marked 'in place' in sensor status sheet, but only found D00829, FC5820, and E56385. Assume others were decommissioned in 2023. 

#### Soil VWC/T/EC
Port 1 disconnected. Lots of elk interaction. All others reading OK. Downloaded prior year of data. There were 120K records in total - 1 hour download. Left data on board and will try to get it all another time. Record is from 11-06-2024 to 11-06-2025 but probably back to 2021 on board. 

#### Snow DTP
D00829
Data download OK. Complete record 06-18-2024--11-06-2025. Probes dead below #6. Removed. 

FC5820
This ID was written on jar in Sharpie but F55521 is printed on jar -- think original logger was replaced in 2023. Complete record from 10-02-2023 to 07-26-2024. Logger electronics broken but still readable. Probes all dead. Removed. 

#### Soil DTP
E56385

## 11/05/2025
### LE-PLN2
Arrived: 15:30 
Exited: 4:01
Personnel: Worsham, Beutler

Data download and maintenance. Site in great shape. Soil VWC is only instrument left here now. 

#### Soil VWC/T/EC
All ports connected and functional at all ports. Data download took 12 minutes - 22K records. Data download successful. Complete record 08-13-24--11-05-2025. Added dessiccant, which was missing. Tightened cables again. Batteries went to 0 in winter a few times. Replaced batteries - at 74% on arrival. Deleted data after download. 

## 10/28/2025

### CA-CAR3
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Beutler, Shirley  

Soil VWC array is the only infrastructure present now. All functional. 

#### Soil VWC/T/EC
Unfortunately, all but one cable had been pulled out of their ports; this is despite the cables being very well secured and taped on the outside (?) we did our best to add hose clamp, zip ties, and electric tape to reinforce them. It's hard to tell what's causing the cable pull - there were teeth marks on logger + tape, but it could also be good ole snow creep.

### CC-CVS1
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Beutler, Shirley  

#### Soil VWC/T/ET
Data downloaded successfully. Port 1 (10A) was disconnected starting 7/25/25. Last retrieval on 06/17/24 returned only about a month of data, as logger had died 10/06/2023. No additional data retrieved 10/06/23--06/17/24, unfortunately... so wasn't a reading error. But record was complete 06/17/24--10/28/2025, except for that disconnected Port 1. Teeth marks on logger and tape. 

#### Snow DTP
E029EE
No logger present. Removed the whole probe. Realized I never replaced logger after removing for reading out of field last summer. 

#### Air T/RH
Logger dead. No read. Removed. Need to send to Onset for read. 

## 8/16/2025

### SG-NES1
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Katz  

#### Soil VWC/T/EC
We were able to get downloads from the soil moisture probes via the Zentra app. The interface showed a "bad battery" message, but we didn't have replacements on hand. 

### Snow DTP
D15344  
We were also able to download data from one of the snow DTP probes. Was there ever a second probe at this site? There was a second fence post, but nothing attached to it, and we found tape lying on the ground nearby. (No)

#### Soil DTP
D1E4DD  
Data download failed. We weren't able to get data from the two soil DTP probes at the site. One probe showed up in the Thermal 2 app, but the app crashed whenever we started the download. The other didn't show up at all; there weren't obvious problems with the probe, so perhaps the battery is dead?

FF10A3  
Data download failed. 

### Air T/RH
We also had no luck with the air temp/RH data download. I'm guessing the hobo sensor battery is dead. We left all the sensors in place. 

More details in the field notebook scan saved here. 

## 8/10/2025
### ER-APU1

## 8/9/2025
### SR-PVG1
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Kueppers  

#### Soil VWC/T/EC
Data downloaded successfully. Complete record 08-05-2021--08-09-2025. Battery went to 0 for part of winter. Need to wipe data at next visit. 

#### Air T/RH
Data download failed. The Hobo battery was extremely low (1%) and I was unable to see any files (not sure if that was a low battery situation or something else. Also, the shield for the air T/RH sensor is mounted sideways, so I'd be cautious about data from that in any case.

#### Snow DTP
DA9321  
I tried to get the snow/soil profile data too, but the app on the tablet that Curtis gave us was glitchy. The data would start to download and then the app would crash. I tried at least 15 times, including after restarting the tablet. 

#### Soil DTP
None present. 

## 8/8/2025

### XX-CAR3
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Beutler  

- Sensor data download and maintenance. 
- Due to the massive snowpack this spring all sensors have been compromised and most sensors have been broken beyond repair :(
- The bad: 
- All the DTP sensor loggers had been sheared/broken off the pole
- Hobo gill shield had been smashed off of the t-post & the hobo casing had been split open exposing the logger (I was not able to connect so brought hobo back from the field)
- The plastic tabs that hold the meter box had been ripped off - so the logger was hanging open by the sensor cables and every cable had been pulled out of its respective port (port 1 had broken off completely.
- The good:
- The meter logger was still running and I was able to successfully download! The values all the sensors were reading (except port 1 -10cm) after I plugged them back in seemed reasonable too (screenshot attached). The data file indicates that as the snowpack ripened in May snow creep destroyed most of this infrastructure.
- Since the tabs have sheared off the meter box there's not a great way to mount it, but I taped it back on the t-post for the time being. 
- Meter sensors can likely be saved - with a new box or creative way to fix it to the T-Post (and maybe a new, taller t post). 
- Picked up all the micro trash I could find at the site but left the DTP probes themselves in case there's any chance of salvaging them.

#### Soil VWC/T/EC

### ER-APU1
Arrived: 10:40  
Exited: 11:25  
Personnel: Worsham, Fauteux  

#### Site note
Site appears dry, 0% snow at date of visit. Sensor site in comparatively good condition. Snow probes have a slight downhill lean, but no breaks or bends impacting data transmission. Soil probes are both warped and damaged, likely a result of snow heave. HOBO radiation shield mount broken and wires damaged. No evidence of animal interaction. Replaced broken zip ties on conduit and T-post.

#### Soil VWC/T/C
Data downloaded successfully. Data appear reasonable. Some NAs for EC at A30 and B60.

#### Air T/RH
Data corrupt. Retrieved only a single, implausible reading from August 2021 (before October installation…). HOBO radiation shield mount broken. Removed the whole system for data retrieval, repair and reinstallation in July. 

#### Snow DTP
E8DC95  
Data all OK. Probe bent downslope, otherwise in good condition. Measurements in sensor status spreadsheet.

30% snow in plot, but no snow in contact with sensors. Snow and soil probes severely bent. One soil probe bent cross-slope, suggesting animal damage (maybe cattle stepped on it). One snow probe’s PVC support broken above rebar.

#### Soil VWC/T/C
Data downloaded successfully and appear complete and reasonable. Battery dropped to 0% in Jan/Feb, likely due to total snow cover.
