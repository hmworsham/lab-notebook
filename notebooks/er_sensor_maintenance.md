### ER-APU1
Arrived: 10:40  
Exited: 11:25  
Personnel: Worsham, Fauteux  

#### Site note
Site appears dry, 0% snow at date of visit. Sensor site in comparatively good condition. Snow probes have a slight downhill lean, but no breaks or bends impacting data transmission. Soil probes are both warped and damaged, likely a result of snow heave. HOBO radiation shield mount broken and wires damaged. No evidence of animal interaction. Replaced broken zip ties on conduit and T-post.

#### Soil VWC/T/C
Data downloaded successfully. Data appear reasonable. Some NAs for EC at A30 and B60.

#### Air T/RH
Data corrupt. Retrieved only a single, implausible reading from August 2021 (before October installation…). HOBO radiation shield mount broken. Removed the whole system for data retrieval, repair and reinstallation in July. 

#### Snow DTP
