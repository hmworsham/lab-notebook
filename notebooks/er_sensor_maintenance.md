#### Site note
Sensor site in VERY bad shape. One snow DTP (D15344) bent to severe angle, other (F3F4B3) bent in curve to 130º+. Did not find either soil DTP—still under snow. Will return in July for soil DTP data and measurements. 

#### Soil VWC/T/C
Data downloaded successfully. Data all OK. 

#### Air T/RH
Data downloaded successfully. Data all OK, but under snow much of winter. HOBO mount broken, with sensor dangling to 39 cm. No height measurement before break. Will return later in season to fix the mount.
