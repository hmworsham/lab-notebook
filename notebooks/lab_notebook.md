### Goals
- Finalize data cleaning script

- Continued cleaning up `er-forest-inventory` repo
- Tested sequential scripts again and all run start-to-finish
- Split out write-to-drive scripts as sub-numbers (03.02)

### TODO:
- Make sure scripts can all be knit
- Double check files accessed from Drive are public and/or stick them in `data/raw` before sending out as compendium

### Goals
1. Append Latitude, Longitude, and GPS_Filename to inventory data
2. Clean so that there's one file per plot per census
3. Analyses

### Questions
- But do we re-export the data, amending the original input file? 
- Is the code just to show what we did or is it actually reproducible?
- At what point do we consider the inventory data 'immutable'?
- If we keep adding the lat/lon of trees, then we have to do it every damn time
- Maybe better just to associate them in the cleaning and processing workflow, not re-exporting the joined data ... 
- What about the cleaned-up, collated data? Do we export? Eventually we have to for ESS-DIVE archive
- One way to think about it: 
 - Consider geotagging and cleaning one discrete, self-contained workflow
 - Export the results as a complete dataset
