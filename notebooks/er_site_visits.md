### SG-SES1  
Arrived: 15:10   
Exited: 17:00  
Personnel: Worsham  
  
Soil sampling for HYPROP. Protocol:  
  
- Dug pit to 15 cm  
- Exposed flat surface at bottom  
- Using a rubber mallet, hammered sampling ring to flush with soil surface  
- Used trowel to dig out soil around ring  
- Pulled out ring, using trowel to preserve soil at bottom, and leaving some soil mounded on top  
- Cut mound so soil level was flush with edge of ring  
- Soil was extremely dry and somewhat rocky: may have lost some soil or disrupted pore structure especially near the bottom of the sample   
- Removed sample at 16:35. Check SM records.  
- Distance to logger: 3.2 m  
  
Notes:   
- Had to dig 3 pits and refill 2  
- First tried to hammer without plastic top on top of ring, and soil bounced out with hammering  
- Also tried extracting ring without trowel assist, and soil all poured out  
- In second pit, tried using trowel to assist extraction, but still lost a lot of soil  
- Conclusion was that I needed to dig down well below the bottom of the ring to pull ring and soil out with minimal disturbance

### CC-CVS1  
Arrived: 09:30    
Exited: 15:45    
Personnel: Worsham    
Coring. Cored all possible trees within CC-CVS1 plot boundaries. Still need to core 9 ABLA outside plot. For a timing benchmark, was able to take A and B cores from 24 trees in 6 hours. Removed dead soil probe CD187B.

### CC-CVS1  
Arrived: 13:30    
Exited: 15:30    
Personnel: Worsham    
Coring. Sampled A and B cores from 7 trees. Will likely need to sample ABLA out of plot (OOP), as there just aren't very many canopy ABLA within bounds.   
  
### Research Meadow  
Personnel: Worsham    
Practice coring in research meadow trees. Key lessons: (1) measure sapwood depth before putting core in straw... (2) try to keep the borer vertically perpendicular to the growth angle of the tree for most accurate ring-widths.

### SG-NES1  
Arrived: 11:10    
Exited: 11:55    
Personnel: Worsham, Kueppers

### SG-NWS1  
Arrived: NA    
Exited: NA    
Personnel: Worsham, Kueppers, Fauteux    
Site installation. Set up 4 corners for inventory in August. Did not take GPS readings. Need to do so in August. Site sits a few hundred m beyond the summit of Snodgrass and is QUITE DENSE and uneven-aged. Mild slope, a few snow-maintained gaps, fairly dry WNW facing site. Lots of ABLA and even more PIEN in understory. No PICO evident. Temperature is remarkably cool (T≈40ºF), compared to other aspects on Snodgrass, with <5% snow evident, despite much more remaining on N aspects near summit. Likely has had a short growing season historically, but now longer, as suggested by the abundance of seedlings and saplings and relatively short-statured older trees. Patchy ground cover is primarily *Vaccinium myrtillus*.

### ER-APU1

### SR-PVG1  
Arrived: NA    
Exited: NA    
Personnel: Worsham, Fauteux    
  
Sensor data download and maintenance. Site somewhat moist. 30% snow in plot, but no snow in contact with sensors. Lots of deadfall, likely more than in 2021. Very little ground cover, perhaps because of cattle grazing in summer/fall 2021. Sensor site in very poor condition. See maintenance records for details.   
  
### XX-PLN2  
Arrived: 09:00   
Exited: 10:40   
Personnel: Worsham, Fateux

## 6/12/22  
### XX-FAR1  
Arrived: 07:30    
Exited: 10:00    
Personnel: Worsham, Kueppers, Fauteux    
Site installation at higher of two potential Brush Creek sites. Actually in Farris Creek drainage, so will name accordingly. It's a unique looking site. The surrounding area is some mature PIEN/ABLA but a lot of PICO interspersed. Nearby there are exclusive PICO stands and some past char still evident on deadfall and a few standing dead stems, suggesting a stand-clearing fire within the last century or so. Site itself is heavy on PICO. The slope is gentle, 5-10%, and the site is NW facing. Understory is sparse but LOTS of PIEN seedlings and saplings. Not much PIEN in the canopy, it appears, but much ABLA. E corner abuts a deep, likely intermittent drainage with some surface flow on 6/12/22. Soil is shallow, and there is abundant deadfall, especially to the N and W of the plot, including some large dead within the plot bounds.   
  
## 6/11/22  
### ER-BME3  
Arrived: NA    
Exited: NA    
Personnel: Worsham, Kueppers, Fauteux    
Site installation at third Baldy East site. Found viable site about 10 m E of original proposed plot. Still a lot of snow on the ground, so couldn't finalize corners. Will need to return to set corners in July. Used a red handkerchief for flagging. Put in 2 corner stakes where soil was exposed and geotagged all proposed corner locations, but will need to update geotags once corners are adjusted for slope and finalized. Slope angle is mild and the site faces approximately E, to the extent it has an aspect at all. Small bump or drop near center, parallel to slope. May just be a buried tree, but may want to reevaluate site for suitability after snowmelt. That soil which is exposed is very rocky, but hard to assess understory and ground cover. Need to look out for standing water and drainage after melt. PIEN and ABLA dominate the canopy in apparently equal numbers. This is a mature stand.

### ER-APL1  
Arrived: 14:15    
Exited: 15:00    
Personnel: Worsham    
Sensor data download and maintenance. Lots of deadfall in plot, far more than last year, probably owing to winter and spring winds. Site very damp, as usual. 10% snow. Slightly windy. T≈15ºC. 60% cloud cover. Probes and infrastructure all seem in good shape.  
  
## 6/9/22  
### Snodgrass NW Slope 1  
Personnel: Worsham    
Scouting. Decent site. Gentle slope. PIEN/ABLA dominated, with lots of short-statured mature trees and dense seedlings/saplings. Some logging evidence between summit and site. Lots of deadfall. Not much exposed, visible rock. NW aspect. Ground cover herbaceous, sparse. 20-30% snow cover.  
  
### SG-NES1
