Exited: 16:00  
Personnel: Worsham, Powell MT, Sewanee (5)  
Installation and first census. About 300 trees, so moderately dense. In the upper left corner of the plot are a lot of dense pines. Otherwise clumpy. Sparse understory, and mostly fir in the smaller age classes. Somewhat dry site, lying on a local nose just above a small intermittent drainage, which was dry today. At landscape scale, the site is somewhat concave.

## 7/17/22
### ER-APU1
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Worsham, Henderson A, Peterson A   
Coring. No major changes in site since June. Warm, windy and dry. All cores taken within plot boundaries.

## 7/14/22
### XX-CAR3
Arrived: 09:15  
Exited: 14:00  
Personnel: Worsham, Henderson A  
Coring. Dry site. 50% cloud cover at arrival, but clearing. Storms at 13:30. No major changes in site since June. T=70ºF. Had to go outside the plot boundaries for several ABLA and did not get a full 20. Additional trees located along N and W edges within 10 m of plot boundary. 

## 7/13/22
### SR-PVG1
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Worsham, Kaufman E  
Coring. Site dry. Storms toward noon. Had to go outside plot boundaries for several trees. Additional trees located along N edge within 10 m of plot boundary, except 8682 at NE corner and 8688, just W of NW corner. Removed broken snow probe (D0E2CF) and broken soil probe (F69C60).

### CC-CVS1
Arrived: 08:50  
Exited: 11:00  
Personnel: Worsham, Kaufman E  
Coring. Clear morning. T≈60ºF. Site damp at arrival. Sampled out-of-plot (OOP) trees. Additional trees located along N and E edges within 10 m of plot boundary. Tagged and measured DBH, CII, canopy position for new OOP trees.

## 7/12/22
### CC-CVS1
Arrived: 09:30  
Exited: 15:45  
Personnel: Worsham  
Coring. Cored all possible trees within CC-CVS1 plot boundaries. Still need to core 9 ABLA outside plot. For a timing benchmark, was able to take A and B cores from 24 trees in 6 hours. Removed dead soil probe CD187B.

## 7/11/22
### CC-CVS1
Arrived: 13:30  
Exited: 15:30  
Personnel: Worsham  
Coring. Sampled A and B cores from 7 trees. Will likely need to sample ABLA out of plot (OOP), as there just aren't very many canopy ABLA within bounds. 

### Research Meadow
Personnel: Worsham  
Practice coring in research meadow trees. Key lessons: (1) measure sapwood depth before putting core in straw... (2) try to keep the borer vertically perpendicular to the growth angle of the tree for most accurate ring-widths.

## 6/16/22
### CC-CVS1
Arrived: 07:55  
Exited: 09:30  
Personnel: Worsham  
Sensor data download and maintenance. Took gland-to-ground and other measurements for all sensors. 

## 6/15/22
### SG-SWR1

Relaunched HOBO air T/RH logger, having forgotten to do so on 6/9/21. Sampling begins at 13:00. 

### SG-NES1
Arrived: 11:10  
Exited: 11:55  
Personnel: Worsham, Kueppers  
Sensor data download and maintenance. Site mostly dry. Still some snow covering soil sensors, so did not get full GTG measurements, though all data were retrievable. 

### SG-NWS1
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Worsham, Kueppers, Fauteux  
Site installation. Set up 4 corners for inventory in August. Did not take GPS readings. Need to do so in August. Site sits a few hundred m beyond the summit of Snodgrass and is QUITE DENSE and uneven-aged. Mild slope, a few snow-maintained gaps, fairly dry WNW facing site. Lots of ABLA and even more PIEN in understory. No PICO evident. Temperature is remarkably cool (T≈40ºF), compared to other aspects on Snodgrass, with <5% snow evident, despite much more remaining on N aspects near summit. Likely has had a short growing season historically, but now longer, as suggested by the abundance of seedlings and saplings and relatively short-statured older trees. Patchy ground cover is primarily *Vaccinium myrtillus*.

## 6/14/22
### ER-APU1  
Arrived: 10:40  
Exited: 12:30  
Personnel: Worsham, Fauteux  
Sensor data download and maintenance. Approach was very difficult for Fauteux. Took over 2 hours to access site, and scrambling was quite uncomfortable. Keep in mind for research assistants with limited experience in mountain terrain in future. 

## 6/13/22
### SR-PVG1
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Worsham, Fauteux  

Sensor data download and maintenance. Site somewhat moist. 30% snow in plot, but no snow in contact with sensors. Lots of deadfall, likely more than in 2021. Very little ground cover, perhaps because of cattle grazing in summer/fall 2021. Sensor site in very poor condition. See maintenance records for details. 

### XX-PLN2
Arrived: 09:00 
Exited: 10:40 
Personnel: Worsham, Fateux  

Sensor data download and maintenance. Site is generally in good shape. No bends or warps on the DTP probes. Soil looks very dry. Clear day, but somewhat smoky/hazy and light wind. 

## 6/12/22
### XX-FAR1
Arrived: 07:30  
Exited: 10:00  
Personnel: Worsham, Kueppers, Fauteux  
Site installation at higher of two potential Brush Creek sites. Actually in Farris Creek drainage, so will name accordingly. It's a unique looking site. The surrounding area is some mature PIEN/ABLA but a lot of PICO interspersed. Nearby there are exclusive PICO stands and some past char still evident on deadfall and a few standing dead stems, suggesting a stand-clearing fire within the last century or so. Site itself is heavy on PICO. The slope is gentle, 5-10%, and the site is NW facing. Understory is sparse but LOTS of PIEN seedlings and saplings. Not much PIEN in the canopy, it appears, but much ABLA. E corner abuts a deep, likely intermittent drainage with some surface flow on 6/12/22. Soil is shallow, and there is abundant deadfall, especially to the N and W of the plot, including some large dead within the plot bounds. 

## 6/11/22
### ER-BME3
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Worsham, Kueppers, Fauteux  
Site installation at third Baldy East site. Found viable site about 10 m E of original proposed plot. Still a lot of snow on the ground, so couldn't finalize corners. Will need to return to set corners in July. Used a red handkerchief for flagging. Put in 2 corner stakes where soil was exposed and geotagged all proposed corner locations, but will need to update geotags once corners are adjusted for slope and finalized. Slope angle is mild and the site faces approximately E, to the extent it has an aspect at all. Small bump or drop near center, parallel to slope. May just be a buried tree, but may want to reevaluate site for suitability after snowmelt. That soil which is exposed is very rocky, but hard to assess understory and ground cover. Need to look out for standing water and drainage after melt. PIEN and ABLA dominate the canopy in apparently equal numbers. This is a mature stand. 

### ER-BME1
Arrived: NA  
Exited: NA  
Personnel: Worsham, Kueppers, Fauteux  
Sensor data download and maintenance. Site in bad shape. See maintenance record for details.

## 6/10/22
### XX-CAR3
Personnel: Worsham, Fauteux  
Sensor data download and maintenance. Site is QUITE dry already. 0% snow. No significant mortality change. Ground cover full, extensive, green. Clear morning, T≈10ºC. Sensor site in good shape. 

### Red Mountain 1
Personnel: Worsham, Fauteux  
Scouting. Drive is 50 min + PAST the Carbon TH beyond Ohio Pass. Road is impassable approx. 3 miles from TH. Didn't attempt hike for time. Not a feasible site due to access time and constraints. 

### ER-APL1
Arrived: 14:15  
Exited: 15:00  
Personnel: Worsham  
Sensor data download and maintenance. Lots of deadfall in plot, far more than last year, probably owing to winter and spring winds. Site very damp, as usual. 10% snow. Slightly windy. T≈15ºC. 60% cloud cover. Probes and infrastructure all seem in good shape.

## 6/9/22
### Snodgrass NW Slope 1
Personnel: Worsham  
Scouting. Decent site. Gentle slope. PIEN/ABLA dominated, with lots of short-statured mature trees and dense seedlings/saplings. Some logging evidence between summit and site. Lots of deadfall. Not much exposed, visible rock. NW aspect. Ground cover herbaceous, sparse. 20-30% snow cover.

### SG-NES1
Arrived: 09:45
Exited: 11:00
Personnel: Worsham, Fauteux  
Sensor data download and maintenance. Sensor site somewhat damaged by snow. See sensor maintenance record for details. 

## 6/8/22
### ER-GT1
Arrived: 16:40  
Exited: 18:20  
Personnel: Worsham, Fauteux  
Sensor data download and maintenance. 10-15% snow cover, damp soil. Clear sky. T≈20ºC. Mortality extensive but seems similar to that in 2021. See sensor maintenance record for details.
