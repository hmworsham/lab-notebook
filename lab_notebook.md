1. Append Latitude, Longitude, and GPS_Filename
2. Clean so that there's one file per plot per census
3. Analyses

But do we re-export the data, amending the original input file? 
Is the code just to show what we did or is it actually reproducible?
At what point do we consider the inventory data 'immutable'?
If we keep adding the lat/lon of trees, then we have to do it every damn time
Maybe better just to associate them in the cleaning and processing workflow, not re-exporting the joined data ... 

What about the cleaned-up, collated data? Do we export? Eventually we have to for ESS-DIVE archive

One way to think about it: 
- Consider geotagging and cleaning one discrete, self-contained workflow
- Export the results as a complete dataset
